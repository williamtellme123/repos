== Modern Enterprise Java Architectures with Spring 4.1 at Devoxx France

This is a very basic sample app used during the Modern Enterprise Java Architectures with
Spring 4.1 session at Devoxx France.

The purpose is to show how one can easily build a message listener using AMQP.
AMQP: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol

=== NOTE: You need a RabbitMQ server running on localhost to execute that demo.
=== /etc/hosts add     127.0.0.1 billys-Macbook-Pro
# cd /usr/local/rabbitmq_server-3.5.3/sbin
# ./rabbitmq-server

=== Running the app locally
cd ~/javawork/spring-rabbitMQ-api
mvn spring-boot:run

Execute DemoApplication to get started

=== Open Postman
user: user
pw: changeme

=== GET
http://localhost:8080/

=== POST
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "twitter": "yourTwitterAccountHere",
  "bio": "John Smith's bio."
}

=== GET
http://localhost:8080/speakers
http://localhost:8080/profiles




something like: `curl http://user:changeme@localhost:8080/speakers -i -H "Content-type: application/json" -d @yourfile.json`, where `yourfile.json` is the name of the file holding the new Speaker representation.

NOTE: `changeme` is the password specified for this simple demo; check `src/main/resources/application.properties` for more details.

This should create a new `Speaker` (available from `http://localhost:8080/speakers`) but it should also intercept the event, post an AMQP message and log something to confirm that the AMQP message has been processed.

=== Running the app in the cloud

If you want to run that exact same app in the cloud, you need first an account with a cloud provider. At the time of writing, you can try _Pivotal Web Services_ for free for 60 days, check `https://run.pivotal.io/`

Once you've registered, you should be able to use `cf t` to confirm you are connected to the right organization and space.

Pushing your app to the cloud should be as easy as:

* Build your app: `mvn package`
* Create a RabbitMQ instance to use for your app: `cf create-service cloudamqp lemur my-rabbit`
* Go in the `target` directory and create a `manifest.yml` alongside your `spring41-devoxxfr-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` to bind the RabbitMQ service to your app
```yml
applications:
  - name: my-spring41-demo
    services:
      - my-rabbit
```
* Push the app: `cf push my-spring41-demo -p spring41-devoxxfr-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

NOTE: `my-spring41-demo` is the name of your app and will also be used for the default route of your app (i.e. `my-spring41-demo.cfapps.io`). If that name is taken, update the manifest and the `cf push` command accordingly.

That's it, your app is in the cloud. You can now send a sample _json_ representation of a speaker on the service's URL. You can also use `cf logs my-spring41-demo` to look at the logs of the app.
