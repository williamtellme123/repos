-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. After you complete the previous work for your employer you realize there is a discrepancy 
--    in the data. Cruises have captain ids that are listed in the employee table
--    but the employee table also contains a column position_id and captains listed in the cruises table 
--    do not all match the position type in the employee table.
--    You tell this to your boss.
--    He says treat the cruise data as the most up to date and everything else should be updated to match.
--    Write a SQL statement to update accordingly.




-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. While you are talking to the boss he also says, please check to see if there
--    are any overlaps in the cruise schedule. In other words is any one captain scheduled to be on 
--    two different cruises at the same time?
--    Write a SQL query to find out.
