Welcome all of you.
I am excited to teach this class.

I myself have difficulty learning new technologies. That is why I am so
passionate about helping others learn SQL.

If you are eager to get started at home I am including here a file called ORACLE CLASS SETUP.
You can use this along with the files on your USB key to install the same thing we have in class.

Homework 1. Please do Homework 1. People who complete it by Thursday will be called
on in class to read their answers. The rest of the students will be called on next Monday.

Have fun. Send me questions.

Billy
