Hello All.
Happy Friday.

I am uploading two files for Saturday.

In the Chapter 5.sql file are the following topics:

•	Review of Chapter 5 topics already covered
•	Hands on Exercises you can do at home first then repeat in class (if you like)
•	Create a new user called mybooks
•	Copy all the relevant tables from our existing books schema to this new mybooks schema
•	Ask you to write alter table statements from scratch to add primary keys (answers provided for those who would like them)
•	Alter table statements to add foreign keys
•	We will then create an ER diagram that is the correct version of the one in your binders
•	We will review the join topic already covered adding more color, context and examples

In the Functions Chapter 6 and 7.xls file are the following topics:
•	List of the functions in Chapter Nos. 6 & 7

If time permits we will be starting Chapter 6 on Saturday using that spreadsheet as a jumping off point

I also put these two files on Dropbox today that you might find interesting :: Homework
•	HW Learning New Technology.doc
•	HW Actors Movies Roles.doc

Homework is optional. The intention behind it is to encourage you to practice outside of class. If you have questions please email me.
Thank you.

See you Saturday!

Billy
