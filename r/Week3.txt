      Jerry Smith
-- ----------------------------------------------
Descriptive
      Least amount of effort
      Quantitatively describe main features of collection of data
      Typically first analysis done on a data set
      Commonly applied to large volumes of data (census data)
      Description and interpretation processes are different steps
      Univariate and Bivariate are two types of statistical descriptive analyses (census)
-- ----------------------------------------------
Exploratory
      Find previously unknown relationships / connections
      Define future studies/questions
      Not definitive
      Correlation does not imply causation
-- ----------------------------------------------
Inferential
      Test theories about the nature of the world in general
      Use small sample to say something about a bigger population
      Commonly the goal of statistical models
      Estimate quantity and uncertainty about your estimate
      Inference depends heavily on both the population and the sampling scheme
-- ----------------------------------------------
Predictive
      Prediction does not mean that the independent variables cause
      if x predict y does not mean y predicts x
      Accuracy depends heavily on measuring the right variables
      Although there are better and worse prediction models, More data and a simple model works really well
      Prediction is very hard, especially about the future references
-- ----------------------------------------------
Casual
      What happens to X when you change Y
      Implementation usually requires randomized studies
      There are approaches to inferring causation in non-randomized studies but difficult
      Causal models are said to be the “gold standard” for data analysis
-- ----------------------------------------------
Mechanistic
      Most Effort
      Understand exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects
      Incredibly hard to infer, except in simple situations
      Usually modeled by a deterministic set of equations (physical/engineering science)
      Generally the random component of the data is measurement error
      If the equations are known but the parameters are not, they may be inferred with data analysis
      What changes in design lead to changes in function of pavement

In statistics, a confounding variable (also confounding factor, a confound, or confounder)
is an extraneous variable in a statistical model that correlates (directly or inversely)
with both the dependent variable and the independent variable.

-- WHAT IS DATA
-- ----------------------------------------------
Data are the values of qualitative or quantitative variables belonging to a set of items (things)
